Sandstorm uses [miniSTARK](https://github.com/andrewmilson/ministark/) to generate, almost ðŸ˜‰, [SHARP](https://starknet.io/docs/sharp.html) compatible proofs for Cairo programs. The prover was built by reverse engineering [StarkWare's StarkEx verifier](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts). So far Sandstorm uses exactly the same trace layout as SHARP but the verifier challenges, proof serialization format and constraint composition coefficients differ. These differences prevent users from submitting a Sandstorm generated proof to StarkWare's Ethereum smart contract.

Those curious about how Sandstorm works can look at the comments in [air.rs](src/air.rs) and look at the [high level trace layout spreadsheet](TODO). The comments expect some understanding of how STARK proofs work - [Anatomy of a STARK](https://aszepieniec.github.io/stark-anatomy/) by [Alan Szepieniec](https://twitter.com/aszepieniec) is a great resource for this. Also the [Cairo whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1063.pdf) section 4.5 pseudo code provides a nice high level overview of how some of the pieces fit together.

## Demo - proving Cairo programs

```bash
cargo run -r -F gpu,asm,parallel -- prove \
    --memory ./tmp/memory.bin \
    --program ./tmp/program.json \
    --trace ./tmp/trace.bin

source ~/cairo_venv/bin/activate
cairo-compile tmp/program.cairo --output tmp/program.json
cairo-run --program ./tmp/program.json --trace_file ./tmp/trace.bin --memory_file ./tmp/memory.bin
```
